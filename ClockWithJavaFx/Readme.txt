"ClockWithJavaFx"

-----------------------------------------------------------
Descriptions:

It is a clock developed using Java and JavaFx.

Though, it is not a direct copy, it should be noted that this program is implemented by following the instructions in book - "Y.Daniel Liang (2015).Introduction to Java Programming, Comprehensive Version, 10th Ed." On top of it, I added a few functionalities such as enabliing and disabling the automatic update of the clock for every second.

-----------------------------------------------------------
How to use it:

This is a Maven project, so Maven should be installed. Navigate to the "my-app" folder, and type in the following commands in the CMD.

"mvn clean compile javafx:run"
